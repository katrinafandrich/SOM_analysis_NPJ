This repository contains a few scripts from my PhD research where I trained a machine learning model to identify the relationship between the largescale circulation over the North Pacific and heavy rainfall in Hawaii.
Once this relationship was established, I then projected CMIP6 data onto the model to better understand how this may change in a future climate.

The scripts read best in this order:
1. som_analysis_NPJ.ipynb
2. boxplots_cmip6.ipynb
3. disturbance_analysis.ipynb

In addition to the Self-Organizing Map, which is an unsupervised learning method, I also experimented with the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, which is a supervised learning method.

4. KNN_analysis.ipynb
