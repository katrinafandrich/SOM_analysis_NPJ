This repository contains a few scripts from my PhD research where I trained a machine learning model to identify the relationship between the largescale circulation over the North Pacific and heavy rainfall in Hawaii.
Once this relationship was established, I then projected CMIP6 data onto the model to better understand how this may change in a future climate.

In addition to the Self-Organizing Map, which is an unsupervised learning method, I also experimented with the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, which is a supervised learning method.
